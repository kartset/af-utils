## Getting started

When you need to render a list, table or grid with a lot of rows or columns, you may face performance problems.
A lot of DOM nodes must be allocated and updated (if needed),
but only a few of them are visible.

One way to optimize this is called virtualization.
Based on scroll position and size of each item we may calculate,
what range must be shown. Only visible elements are rendered with this approach.

<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-8 justify-center">
    <img src="/messy.jpg" className="m-0 p-0 shrink shadow-lg" />
    <div className="flex-auto relative min-w-[14em] min-h-[10em] shadow-lg">
        <div className="absolute inset-0">
            <List className="h-[300px]" />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

export default ({ children }) => (
    <>
        <CommonHead title="Getting started" />
        {children}
    </>
);

export const getStaticProps = () => ({ props: { dirtyMdxLayout: "virtual" } });
