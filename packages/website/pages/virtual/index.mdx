# Getting started

When you need to render a list, table or grid with a lot of rows or columns, you may face performance problems.
A lot of DOM nodes must be created, but only a few of them are visible.

One way to optimize this is called virtualization.
Based on scroll position and size of each item we may calculate the range to show.
Only visible elements are rendered with this approach.

<IndexExample />

Components ([List](/virtual/list), [Table](/virtual/table)) are available for basic use cases.
If you want maximum flexibility â€” [headless](/virtual/headless) API is for you.
Variable item sizes with <span className="whitespace-nowrap">on-the-fly</span> remeasurement are also supported.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <>
        <CommonHead title="Getting started" />
        {children}
    </>
);

export const getStaticProps = () => ({ props: { dirtyMdxLayout: "virtual" } });
