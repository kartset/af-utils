# Frequently asked questions

## Why do I need to use ref?

In order to work smoothly, library must know scrolled item sizes. Initially they
are taken with the help of `getEstimatedItemSize` param. But this is usually not
enough, because estimated and real sizes may differ. `ResizeObserver` is used internally
for more accurate measurements, but you must provide mounted items explicitly in
conjunction with their indexes.

## Do I need to use css classes, provided in examples?

Not necessary. This website was build with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
but you may use your styling approach.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <>
        <CommonHead title="Docs: Frequently asked questions" />
        {children}
    </>
);

export const getStaticProps = () => ({ props: { dirtyMdxLayout: "virtual" } });
