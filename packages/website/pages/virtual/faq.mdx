# Frequently asked questions

## Why do I need to use ref?

In order to work smoothly, library must know scrolled item sizes. Initially they
are taken with the help of `getEstimatedItemSize` param. But this is usually not
enough, because estimated and real sizes may differ. `ResizeObserver` is used internally
for more accurate measurements, but you must provide mounted items explicitly in
conjunction with their indexes.

## Do I need to use css classes, provided in examples?

Not necessary. This website was build with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/),
but you may use your styling approach.

## How many items virtual scroller can handle?

Maximum `itemCount` value is `2_147_483_647` (int32 max).
This limit exists, because item sizes cache implementation has bitwise operations, which work only with int32.
But there is one more limit. W3C does not provide maximum allowed values for height, width, margin, etc.

This quote was found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/). Chrome's experimentally found maximum value is `33_554_428`.
So some problems _may_ happen if your `scrollSize` is bigger.
