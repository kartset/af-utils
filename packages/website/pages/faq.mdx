## Frequently asked questions

-   _When scrolling without moving mouse, scrolling completely stops until the mouse is moved again. How to fix it?_

    I have no idea why is this happening, but it can be fixed by adding <code className="language-css">will-change: scroll-position</code> or <code className="language-css">
    transform: translateZ(0)</code> to scroll wrapper.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <MdxWrapper>
        <CommonHead title="Docs: Frequently asked questions" />
        {children}
    </MdxWrapper>
);
